# Formalization Status

This project distinguishes two claims:

1. **Backend verification coverage:** active Lean code checks successfully.
2. **Faithful theorem formalization:** the checked statement closely matches the course theorem AND the proof is a real derivation, not a structural projection from an axiomatized conclusion.

The first claim is useful engineering evidence. The second is the academic claim. Do not collapse them.

## Status Vocabulary

- `full`: a faithful formal **derivation** of the textbook theorem from its hypotheses. The hypotheses must be encoded honestly (not the conclusion in disguise) and the proof must do real work — `ring`/`simp`/`rfl` on a structure-projection target does NOT qualify.
- `library_wrapper`: the active code directly invokes a named Lean library theorem whose statement matches the benchmark theorem. The library does the real work.
- `reduced_core`: the active code is honest but narrower than the textbook theorem. This includes:
  - Algebraic / analytic / distributional core checks (e.g., a constant-θ MGF identity behind Wald's exponential).
  - Lean specifications where the textbook conclusion is encoded as a structure field and the proof reads it off via projection. The structure pins down the textbook STATEMENT but does not derive the conclusion.
- `placeholder`: active prover code verifies but does not yet encode a meaningful formal statement of the textbook theorem.

For delivery claims, count only:

```text
full + library_wrapper
```

Report `reduced_core` and `placeholder` separately. **Spec-with-axiomatized-conclusion is `reduced_core`, not `full`.**

> *Continuous-time first FTAP* in `blueprint.md`.

> **Path-1 upgrades (2026-06-04).** Seven reduced cores earned `full` by the

## History

Per-pass session logs and the pre-2026-05 hybrid-backend validation records
were removed from this file on 2026-05-30, when the SymPy and Isabelle backends
were stripped (the project is Lean-only). They remain in git history. The
2026-05-29 honesty re-audit — the basis for the current counts above — is also
