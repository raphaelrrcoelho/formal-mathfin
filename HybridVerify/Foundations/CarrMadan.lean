# Carr-Madan static replication — stub / acknowledgement

The full Carr-Madan identity

  `g(S) = g(F) + g'(F)(S − F) + ∫₀^F g''(K)(K − S)⁺ dK + ∫_F^∞ g''(K)(S − K)⁺ dK`

is a Taylor-with-integral-remainder application that requires Mathlib's
intervalIntegral machinery. The algebraic core (the log-payoff identity
`log(S) − log(F) = log(S/F)`) is literally `Real.log_div`, and the
*log-payoff variance-swap connection* is already realised in
`BlackScholes/VarianceSwap.lean` (the `varianceSwap_log_contribution`
theorem there is the substantive Carr-Madan-style result we have).

This file used to record `carrMadan_log_payoff_algebra` as a separate
theorem. The honest content was a rename of `Real.log_div`; it has been
removed. Refer to `BlackScholes/VarianceSwap.lean` for the Carr-Madan-style
log-payoff replication actually formalised.
