# Quant finance, formally verified

A Lean 4 library of machine-checked quant-finance theorems, built on Mathlib
and Degenne's BrownianMotion. 251 theorems across 11 areas — Black-Scholes
with the full Greek matrix and the exotics, binomial trees with American /
Bermudan / Snell envelope, fixed income with hazard credit and Vasicek SDE,
portfolio theory from Markowitz to Black-Litterman, coherent risk measures,
Kelly, mortality, and constant-product AMMs.

|  | count |
|---|---:|
| total theorems | 251 |
| **full derivations** | **211** |
| library wrappers | 24 |
| reduced cores (Mathlib-gated) | 16 |
| placeholders | **0** |

Every `full` derivation is `#print axioms`-clean: it depends only on the
three Mathlib standard axioms `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]`.

```

The `bs_identity` magic-identity collapse drives delta, gamma, theta, vega,
rho, vanna, volga, and the BS PDE forward direction. See
[`QuantFin/Examples.lean`](QuantFin/Examples.lean) for a curated
five-proof tour.

## Quick start

```bash
# Pull the pinned image (~3 min) instead of building locally (~15 min)
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml pull verify

# Build the entire library — clean exit means every theorem typechecks
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint bash verify -lc 'lake build'

# Run a benchmark chapter
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm verify benchmarks/mathematical_finance.json
```

Fast authoring loop (5–30s feedback via persistent REPL daemon):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up -d lean-repl
./scripts/lean-check.sh QuantFin/<Section>/<Module>.lean
```

The library leans on seven **structural-principle modules** where one named
fact generates dozens of one-line corollaries (Garman normal form, price
bounds, K-convexity at three scales, convex pricing functional, standard
gaussian MGF, exponential discount, Snell envelope). See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full catalogue.

## What's not done (yet)

The 16 remaining `reduced_core` theorems are Mathlib-gated:

- **Itô calculus** (~12 theorems including Itô's lemma path-wise form, time-dependent Itô, Lévy's martingale characterisation, SDE existence + uniqueness, the four Girsanov entries): Mathlib does not yet ship the Itô integral.
- **Continuous-time Poisson processes** (3 theorems: interarrival exponential, superposition, thinning): Mathlib has only the discrete `PoissonPMF`.
- **Fine BM path machinery** (3 theorems: reflection principle on Brownian paths, nowhere-differentiability, law of iterated logarithm).

The library will revisit these when the supporting Mathlib infrastructure
lands. Algebraic / structural cores are already in place; only the L²-limit
glue layer is gated. See [`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md).

## Related upstream contributions

Drafted as part of this project (source under [`upstream/`](upstream/)):

- **Mathlib**: `gaussianReal_zero_one_Iic_neg`, `gaussianReal_zero_one_Ioi_toReal`, `exp_mul_gaussianPDFReal_zero_one`, `integral_exp_mul_gaussianPDFReal_zero_one_Ioi` (standard normal tail + completing-the-square primitives).
- **Remy Degenne's `brownian-motion`**: `IsFilteredPreBrownian.squareSubTime_isMartingale`, `IsFilteredPreBrownian.waldExponential_isMartingale` (the two textbook BM martingales).

## Reproducibility

The verify Docker image pins:

- Lean toolchain `4.30.0-rc1`
- Mathlib at commit `f23306121184`
- Remy Degenne's `brownian-motion` library at commit `16d15eb42c`

These are frozen in [`lakefile.lean`](lakefile.lean) + [`lake-manifest.json`](lake-manifest.json) + [`lean-toolchain`](lean-toolchain) at the repo root.

## Acknowledgements

Three modules adapt published Lean 4 formalisations by other authors, with
explicit attribution headers on each file:

- `Foundations/DiscreteIto.lean`, `Foundations/ItoIntegralSimple.lean`, `Foundations/FTAPTwoState.lean` adapt the discretization framework from Tamás Nagy, *"From Itô to Black-Scholes: A Machine-Verified Derivation in Lean 4"*, SSRN [6336503](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6336503), 2026.
- `DeFi/ConstantProductAMM.lean` adapts Pusceddu & Bartoletti, *"Formalizing Automated Market Makers in the Lean 4 Theorem Prover"*, [OASIcs FMBC 2024.5](https://doi.org/10.4230/OASIcs.FMBC.2024.5) (companion code: <https://github.com/dpusceddu/lean4-amm>); underlying economic theory from Bartoletti, Chiang, Lluch-Lafuente, *"A theory of Automated Market Makers in DeFi"*, LMCS 2022.

Adaptations re-implement these results in this library's framework
(real-valued, `gaussianReal`-based BS hypothesis rather than reconstructed
Itô integral, ℝ-positivity rather than `PReal` subtypes). Mathematical
content is unchanged; copyright on the specific adaptation is Raphael
Coelho (Apache 2.0); academic fair use covers the derivative-work
relationship.
