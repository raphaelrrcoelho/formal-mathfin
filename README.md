A Lean 4 library of machine-checked mathematical-finance theorems, built on Mathlib
and Degenne's BrownianMotion. 251 theorems across 11 areas — Black-Scholes
with the full Greek matrix and the exotics, binomial trees with American /
Bermudan / Snell envelope, fixed income with hazard credit and Vasicek SDE,
portfolio theory from Markowitz to Black-Litterman, coherent risk measures,
Kelly, mortality, and constant-product AMMs.

The aim is a comprehensive, honest reference for formally-verified
mathematical finance: broad coverage, and — for every result — an exact
statement of what is proved and what is assumed.

|  | count |
|---|---:|
| total theorems | 251 |
| **full derivations** | **205** |
| library wrappers | 19 |
| reduced cores | 27 |
| placeholders | **0** |

**224 of the 251 are delivery-ready** (`full` + `library_wrapper`); the 27
`reduced_core` entries are honest special cases or algebraic/structural cores
of results whose general form is gated on upstream Mathlib (see *What's not
done*).

Every `full` derivation depends only on the three Mathlib standard axioms
`[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` — there is no `sorry` and no
project-local axiom anywhere in the library. For the load-bearing derivations
(~90 declarations) this is `#print axioms`-pinned as a build invariant in
`MathFin/AxiomAudit.lean`.

## At a glance

```lean
-- MathFin/BlackScholes/PDE.lean — BS delta via the magic identity
lemma hasDerivAt_bsV_S {K r σ : ℝ} (hK : 0 < K) (hσ : 0 < σ)
    {S τ : ℝ} (hS : 0 < S) (hτ : 0 < τ) :
    HasDerivAt (fun s => bsV K r σ s τ) (Phi (bsd1 S K r σ τ)) S := by
  have h_d1_S := hasDerivAt_bsd1_S (r := r) hK hσ hτ hS
  have h_d2_S := hasDerivAt_bsd2_S (r := r) hK hσ hτ hS
  have h_Phi_d1 := (hasDerivAt_Phi (bsd1 S K r σ τ)).comp S h_d1_S
  have h_Phi_d2 := (hasDerivAt_Phi (bsd2 S K r σ τ)).comp S h_d2_S
  have h_V := (hasDerivAt_id S).mul h_Phi_d1
              |>.sub (h_Phi_d2.const_mul (K * Real.exp (-(r * τ))))
  have h_bs := bs_identity (r := r) hS hK hσ hτ
  ...; field_simp; linear_combination -h_bs
```

The `bs_identity` magic-identity collapse drives delta, gamma, theta, vega,
rho, vanna, volga, and the BS PDE forward direction. See
[`MathFin/Examples.lean`](MathFin/Examples.lean) for a curated
five-proof tour.

The library leans on seven **structural-principle modules** where one named
fact generates dozens of one-line corollaries (Garman normal form, price
bounds, K-convexity at three scales, convex pricing functional, standard
gaussian MGF, exponential discount, Snell envelope). See
[`docs/architecture.md`](docs/architecture.md) for the full catalogue.

## What's not done (yet)

27 of the 251 theorems are `reduced_core` — an honest special case or
algebraic/structural core of a result whose fully general form is gated on
upstream Mathlib. By area:

- **Itô calculus** (`stochastic_calculus`, 6): time-dependent Itô, the
  two-dimensional Itô formula, quadratic variation of an Itô process, Lévy's
  martingale characterisation, SDE existence + uniqueness, and Girsanov. (The
  one-dimensional path-wise Itô lemma itself is now `full` — see below.)
- **Risk / portfolio / pricing cores** (`mathematical_finance`, 6): e.g.
  Rockafellar-Uryasev, the American discounted-price supermartingale, the
  N-asset PSD variance bound — algebraic or structural cores rather than the
  full measure-theoretic statements.
- **Markov chains** (5) and **martingales** (1): finite-state / structural
  specifications standing in for the general library theorems.
- **Girsanov** (`girsanov_finance`, 3).
- **Continuous-time Poisson processes** (3): interarrival exponential,
  superposition, thinning — Mathlib has only the discrete `PoissonPMF`.
- **Fine Brownian path machinery** (3): path-wise reflection,
  nowhere-differentiability, law of iterated logarithm.

The continuous-time L²-adapted **Itô integral itself is built** — the bounded
linear map `itoIntegralCLM_T` on `[0,T]` (`Foundations/ItoIntegralCLM.lean`,
axioms-clean, with `∫₀ᵀ B dB = ½(B_T²−B₀²−T)` as its first consumer) — and on
top of it the **continuous-time L² Itô formula** `f(B_T)−f(B_0) =
itoIntegralCLM_T gf' + ½∫₀ᵀ f″(B_s) ds` is now `full`
(`Foundations/ItoFormulaCLM.lean`, `ito_formula_L2_bddDeriv`), derived from
primitives (weighted quadratic variation + vanishing Itô–Taylor remainder +
Riemann↔CLM bridge) and AxiomAudit-pinned. Its scope is `f ∈ C³` with bounded
`f′,f″,f‴`; the gap to the unrestricted-`C²` textbook statement is a
localization step (Summit C), not yet formalized. What remains gated beyond
that is the SDE / Lévy layer that builds on it. See
[`docs/roadmap.md`](docs/roadmap.md).

## Acknowledgements

Three modules adapt published Lean 4 formalisations by other authors, with
explicit attribution headers on each file:

- `Foundations/DiscreteIto.lean` and `Foundations/FTAPTwoState.lean` adapt the discretization framework from Tamás Nagy, *"From Itô to Black-Scholes: A Machine-Verified Derivation in Lean 4"*, SSRN [6336503](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=6336503), 2026.
- `DeFi/ConstantProductAMM.lean` adapts Pusceddu & Bartoletti, *"Formalizing Automated Market Makers in the Lean 4 Theorem Prover"*, [OASIcs FMBC 2024.5](https://doi.org/10.4230/OASIcs.FMBC.2024.5) (companion code: <https://github.com/dpusceddu/lean4-amm>); underlying economic theory from Bartoletti, Chiang, Lluch-Lafuente, *"A theory of Automated Market Makers in DeFi"*, LMCS 2022.

Adaptations re-implement these results in this library's framework
(real-valued, `gaussianReal`-based BS hypothesis rather than reconstructed
Itô integral, ℝ-positivity rather than `PReal` subtypes). Mathematical
content is unchanged; copyright on the specific adaptation is Raphael
Coelho (Apache 2.0); academic fair use covers the derivative-work
relationship.
