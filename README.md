# automated_proofs_quantfin

formal verification of stochastic-processes textbook theorems via a hybrid lean 4 + isabelle/hol + sympy orchestrator. tracks coverage of saporito's *stochastic processes* at the theorem level, with an honest faithfulness audit.

## status

| | count |
|---|---|
| total theorems | 65 |

| reduced cores (upstream-gated) | 16 |
| placeholders | 0 |

every theorem tagged `full` is `#print axioms`-clean: depends only on `[propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound]` (the three standard mathlib axioms).

see `FORMALIZATION_STATUS.md` for the per-theorem audit and `FORMALIZATION_ROADMAP.md` for what's left.

## what makes it different

most lean formalization projects pick one theorem and go deep, or contribute to mathlib directly. this is structured the other way: take a real textbook, audit theorem-by-theorem, distinguish "we proved it" from "we wrapped a library" from "we encoded the statement honestly but haven't derived it yet."

- **honest taxonomy.** every benchmark entry declares `full`, `library_wrapper`, `reduced_core`, or `placeholder`. delivery-claim counts only the first two. the audit policy lives in `FORMALIZATION_STATUS.md`.
- **multi-backend routing.** each theorem can dispatch to lean 4, isabelle/hol, sympy, or several in parallel. the python orchestrator picks based on `domain`. routing table is in `python/router.py`.
- **substantial original derivations**, not in mathlib or in degenne's brownian-motion library at current pins:
  - itô isometry on $L^2(0, T]$ from step-function isometry + π-system density + `LinearMap.extendOfNorm` (`lean/HybridVerify/WienerIntegralL2.lean`, 433 lines)
  - black-scholes call formula from the risk-neutral lognormal hypothesis (`BlackScholesCall.lean`, ~370 lines, no itô used)
  - black-scholes PDE forward direction via the magic identity $S \phi(d_1) = K e^{-r\tau} \phi(d_2)$ (`BlackScholesPDE.lean`)
  - feynman-kac formula identification: heat-kernel convolution equals $\mathbb{E}[g(x + B_t)]$ via `Measure.map` transfer + lebesgue translation invariance (`FeynmanKacHeatEquation.lean`)
  - quadratic variation of brownian motion in $L^1$ form (`BrownianQuadraticVariation.lean`)
  - standard normal CDF derivative $\Phi'(x) = \phi(x)$ via FTC on $\text{Iic}$ decomposition (`GaussianCDFDeriv.lean`). mathlib doesn't ship this; it doesn't ship `Real.erf` either.
- **continuous-time martingale L² convergence** (saporito 4.3.10), promoted to `full` via degenne's `Submartingale.rightCont_iSup_ofReal_ne_top` (`LpContinuousMartingaleConvergence.lean`, 703 lines)
- **doob L² for discrete-time martingales** (mart-thm-2.4.6), via mathlib's discrete `pow_norm_le_pow_norm_of_exponent_le`

reproducibility: lean and isabelle versions are pinned in the verify docker image. the lean toolchain is 4.30.0-rc1 with mathlib at commit `f23306121184` and degenne's brownian-motion at `16d15eb4`. isabelle 2025-2 with `HOL-Probability` prebuilt.

## quick start

pull the prebuilt image (3 min) instead of rebuilding (50 min):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml pull verify
```

run the verifier on a benchmark file:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm verify benchmarks/stochastic_calculus.json -v --timeout 120
```

static coverage report:

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint python3 verify -m python.coverage_report
```

regression tests (router routing, formal-only enforcement, faithfulness-status presence):

```bash
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml run --rm --entrypoint python3 verify -m pytest tests/test_router.py -q
```

## layout

```
python/         orchestrator, backends, router, CLI
  models.py       Domain/Backend/ConfidenceLevel enums, TheoremStatement
  orchestrator.py central coordinator (sequential + parallel dispatch)
  router.py       DEFAULT_ROUTING + PARALLEL_DOMAINS
  cli.py          python -m python.cli benchmarks/file.json
lean/           lake project. mathlib + degenne brownian-motion pinned.
  HybridVerify/   substantial proofs (each > ~50 lines lives here)
benchmarks/     10 json files keyed by saporito chapters
tests/          pytest regression (router + coverage invariants)
docker/         pinned verify image
```

benchmark theorems with non-trivial proofs `import HybridVerify.<Module>` and re-export the named lemma in 5-25 lines. trivial library wrappers stay inline in the json. this split lets `lake build` give each big proof the full incremental-compilation budget while keeping the benchmark snippets short.

## what isn't done

the 16 remaining `reduced_core` theorems all hit one of:

- **itô integral / doleans-dade / girsanov machinery** (4 girsanov + ~8 stochastic-calculus theorems including itô's formula, time-dependent itô, lévy's martingale characterization, SDE existence)
- **continuous-time poisson processes** (3 theorems: interarrival exponential, superposition, thinning). mathlib has only the discrete `PoissonPMF`.
- **fine brownian path machinery** (3 BM pathology theorems: reflection principle, nowhere-differentiability, law of iterated logarithm)

these need upstream work in mathlib or degenne's brownian-motion to unlock. the project will revisit when that lands.

## related upstream work

derived as part of this project, candidates for upstream contribution:

- `gaussianReal_zero_one_Iic_neg`, `gaussianReal_zero_one_Ioi_toReal`, `exp_mul_gaussianPDFReal_zero_one`, `integral_exp_mul_gaussianPDFReal_zero_one_Ioi` (standard normal tail + completing-the-square): drafted as a mathlib PR.
- `IsFilteredPreBrownian.squareSubTime_isMartingale`, `IsFilteredPreBrownian.waldExponential_isMartingale` (the two textbook BM martingales): drafted as a contribution to remy degenne's `brownian-motion` library.
