# Powered call option closed form (first-principles)

The **powered call** with exponent `a : ℕ` pays `max((S_T)^a − K, 0)` at
maturity. Its risk-neutral discounted price has a closed form in the BS
lognormal model — derived here as a direct consequence of `bs_call_formula`
via the structural identity that **`(S_T)^a` is itself a BS terminal**, with
*effective spot* `S_0^a · exp((a−1)rT + a(a−1)/2 σ²T)` and *effective
volatility* `aσ`. No new integral is computed: the only new content is the
algebraic identity reducing the powered case to the standard case.

## Mathematical content

Starting from `S_T = S_0 · exp((r − σ²/2)T + σ√T·Z)`,

  `(S_T)^a = S_0^a · exp(a(r − σ²/2)T + aσ√T·Z)`.

We want to write the RHS as `Š_0 · exp((r − σ̃²/2)T + σ̃√T·Z)` for some
effective spot `Š_0` and volatility `σ̃`. Setting `σ̃ = aσ` gives `σ̃²T =
a²σ²T`, so

  `Š_0 = S_0^a · exp(a(r − σ²/2)T − (r − a²σ²/2)T)`
       = `S_0^a · exp((a−1)rT + a(a−1)/2 σ²T)`.

This `Š_0` is the **risk-neutral expected** value of `(S_T)^a` divided by
`e^{rT}` (a.k.a. the power-forward; see `PowerOption.powerForward_price`).

## Why this is first-principles

The pre-existing `PowerOption.lean` derives `E[(S_T)^a]` from the affine-
shifted standard-normal MGF (one direct integral). This file goes the next
step: it shows the *struck* payoff `max((S_T)^a − K, 0)` also has a closed
form, reducing it not by a new integral but by recognising that the
powered terminal is a standard BS terminal with adjusted spot and
volatility. The whole derivation goes via `bs_call_formula` with no
additional Gaussian work.

## Results

* `bsPowerTerminal`: `(S_T)^a` as a function of the standard-normal sample.
* `bsPowerEffectiveSpot`: `S_0^a · exp((a−1)rT + a(a−1)/2 σ²T)`.
* `bsPowerTerminal_eq_bsTerminal_effective`: the structural reduction
  identity.
* `bsCallHyp_powered`: lift of `BSCallHyp` to the effective-spot /
  effective-volatility setup.
* `bs_power_call_formula`: the closed-form discounted price.

/-- **Black-Scholes powered call pricing formula** (first-principles).
For the powered payoff `max((S_T)^a − K, 0)` under `BSCallHyp`, the discounted
risk-neutral expectation equals the standard BS call price evaluated at the
effective spot `Š_0` and effective volatility `aσ`:

  `e^{−rT} · E_Q[max((S_T)^a − K, 0)]
    = Š_0 · Φ(d̃_1) − K · e^{−rT} · Φ(d̃_2)`,

where `(d̃_1, d̃_2)` are `(bsd1, bsd2)` at `(Š_0, K, r, aσ, T)`.

Proof: rewrite the integrand via `bsPowerTerminal_eq_bsTerminal_effective`
and apply `bs_call_formula` to the lifted hypothesis. -/
