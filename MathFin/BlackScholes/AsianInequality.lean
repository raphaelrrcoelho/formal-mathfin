# Geometric vs arithmetic Asian options

The geometric Asian option's payoff is bounded above by the arithmetic Asian
option's payoff at every state, because the geometric mean of positive numbers
is at most their arithmetic mean (AM-GM).

For prices `S_{t_1}, …, S_{t_n} ≥ 0`:

  `(∏ S_{t_i})^{1/n} ≤ (1/n) ∑ S_{t_i}`.

Since `x ↦ max(x − K, 0)` is monotone non-decreasing:

  `max(geomMean − K, 0) ≤ max(arithMean − K, 0)`.

Integrating over the pricing measure preserves this pointwise inequality, so
the geometric Asian price is bounded above by the arithmetic Asian price.

Results:

* `am_gm_two`: `√(a · b) ≤ (a + b) / 2` for `a, b ≥ 0` (the two-element case).
* `geom_mean_le_arith_mean_n`: weighted AM-GM specialized to equal weights
  `1/n` (uses `Real.inner_le_iff`-style argument via Mathlib).
* `asian_payoff_geom_le_arith_two`: two-time-point geometric Asian payoff is
  bounded above by the arithmetic Asian payoff.
