# Realizing a bounded adapted continuous process as an Itô-integrand class (the σ-realization)

The Itô integral `∫₀ᵀ σ dB` (`ItoIntegralCLM.itoIntegralCLM_T`) takes its integrand from the
**predictable** `L²` space `E := Lp ℝ 2 (trimMeasure_T T)` — an `Lp` class over the trim product
measure on the predictable σ-algebra, never a raw process `σ : ℝ≥0 → Ω → ℝ`. To integrate a genuine
bounded adapted process (e.g. a continuous market price of risk `θ` for the general adapted Girsanov
theorem), one must first **realize** it inside `E`. This is the σ-realization: the last piece of
"the concrete adapted stochastic integral" (SP0, half (i)) that the drift/Itô SDE files build only
for their specific processes.

For an **every-`ω`-continuous** bounded adapted `σ` this is a short assembly on the existing tower —
no a.e./everywhere friction, exactly as `DriftProcessPredictable.driftSimpleProcess` handles its
elementary drift:

* `MathFin.isStronglyPredictable_of_bdd_adapted_cont` — continuous + adapted ⟹ predictable, via
  Degenne's `StronglyAdapted.isStronglyPredictable_of_leftContinuous` (continuity gives the
  left-continuity it wants);
* `MathFin.memLp_uncurry_of_bdd_adapted_cont` — predictable + bounded on the *finite* measure
  `trimMeasure_T T` ⟹ `MemLp … 2`;
* `MathFin.processToLp` — the realization `σ ↦ (its class in E)`, with `processToLp_coeFn` the a.e.
  identification back to `Function.uncurry σ`.

This unblocks the continuous-adapted Girsanov (brick α4): `∫θdB` and its Doléans density are now
formable for a bounded adapted continuous `θ`.

/-- **A bounded adapted continuous process is predictable.** For an `𝓕`-adapted `σ` that is
continuous in time for every `ω`, the space-time function `(t, ω) ↦ σ t ω` is measurable for the
predictable σ-algebra — continuity gives the left-continuity Degenne's
`StronglyAdapted.isStronglyPredictable_of_leftContinuous` requires, and no randomness in the
time-regularity means no exceptional null set to dodge. -/

/-- **A bounded adapted continuous process is `L²` over `trimMeasure_T T`.** It is predictable
(`isStronglyPredictable_of_bdd_adapted_cont`) and bounded, and `trimMeasure_T T` is a finite
measure, so `MemLp.of_bound` applies. -/

/-- **The σ-realization.** A bounded adapted continuous process realized as an element of the
Itô-integrand space `E = Lp ℝ 2 (trimMeasure_T T)` — the domain of
`ItoIntegralCLM.itoIntegralCLM_T`. This is the missing bridge from a raw bounded adapted continuous
process `σ : ℝ≥0 → Ω → ℝ` to `∫₀ᵀ σ dB`; with it, the general continuous-adapted Girsanov density is
formable. -/
