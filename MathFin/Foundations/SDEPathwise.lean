/-! # The strong solution as a pathwise process (SDE existence, the pathwise bridge)

`SDEExistence` produced the strong solution of `dX = b(X)dt + σ(X)dB` as the **abstract**
fixed point `picardSolution ∈ E = Lp ℝ 2 (trimMeasure_T T)` of the Picard map
`Φ(X) = η + driftProcessAssembled(b∘X) + itoProcessAssembled(σ∘X)`. That fixed point is an
`L²` equivalence class on the space–time product; on its own it is not yet a *pathwise* object.

This file slices the fixed-point equation `X = Φ(X)` — which holds in `E` — into a genuine
**pathwise decomposition** of the solution's sample paths:
`X_t(ω) = η(ω) + (drift limit)_t(ω) + (Itô modification)_t(ω)` for almost every `(t, ω)`.

The two analytic terms become honest pathwise processes:
* the **drift** `driftProcessAssembled(b∘X)` — an abstract `extendOfNorm` operator — has `coeFn`
  a.e. equal to the pointwise `limUnder` process `driftContinuousMod(b∘X)`
  (`driftProcessAssembled_coeFn`, the pathwise-realization crux of `DriftProcessModification`),
  itself the a.e. limit of the honest elementary Lebesgue integrals `∫₀ᵗ b(Xⁿ_s) ds`;
* the **Itô** `itoProcessAssembled(σ∘X)` is *by construction* the continuous modification
  `itoContinuousMod(σ∘X)` (`ItoProcessPredictable`), the pathwise `(σ∘X) ● B`.

So the `E`-fixed point genuinely *is* a pathwise strong solution: `sde_pathwise_decomposition`.

The remaining refinement — rewriting `driftContinuousMod(b∘X)_t(ω)` as the single Lebesgue integral
`∫₀ᵗ b(X_s(ω)) ds` (a per-`ω` interval Cauchy–Schwarz limit of `driftSimpleProcess_eq_setIntegral`)
— is a presentational upgrade of the drift term, not a strengthening of the existence statement.

/-- **The strong solution as a pathwise process (the pathwise bridge).** The abstract `E`-fixed point
`picardSolution` decomposes, almost everywhere on the space–time product, into its initial condition,
a pathwise drift, and a pathwise Itô term:
`X_t(ω) = η(ω) + driftContinuousMod(b∘X)_t(ω) + itoContinuousMod(σ∘X)_t(ω)`.
Both analytic terms are genuine pathwise objects — the drift is the a.e. limit of the honest elementary
Lebesgue integrals `∫₀ᵗ b(Xⁿ_s) ds` (`driftProcessAssembled_coeFn`), the Itô term is the continuous
modification `(σ∘X) ● B` (`itoProcessAssembled` is *defined* from `itoContinuousMod`). The fixed-point
equation `X = Φ(X)` holds in `E`; taking `coeFn` through `Lp.coeFn_add` and the two realization
identities slices it into this pathwise form. -/
