# The survival model: age-at-death random variable and conditional survival

The probabilistic foundation of life-contingent actuarial mathematics. A life is described by a
random variable `X : Ω → ℝ`, its **age at death**, on a probability space `(Ω, P)`, with `X > 0`
almost surely. Everything else is derived from the **survival function** (complementary CDF)
`S_X(t) = P(X > t)`.

The design is ours (see the file header); the classical statements were cross-checked against
Yosuke Ito's AFP `Survival_Model`, cited as a source.

The future lifetime of a life aged `x` is `T(x) = X − x`, defined on the event `alive x = {X > x}`
that the life reaches age `x`. Its survival function is the conditional probability
`tpₓ = P(X > x + t ∣ X > x)`, which for `t ≥ 0` collapses to the survival ratio
`tpₓ = S_X(x + t) / S_X(x)` — the keystone of the theory.

## Correspondence with the AFP source (cross-reference only)

For readers coming from the AFP entry, our declarations line up with its `Survival_Model` names:
`alive`↔`alive`, `futureLifetime`↔`futr_life`, `survivalFunction`↔`ccdf (distr 𝔐 borel X)`,
`survive`↔`survive` (`$p_{t&x}`), `die`↔`die` (`$q_{t&x}`), `survivalFunction_zero`↔`ccdfX_0_1`,
`survive_zero`↔`ccdfTx_0_1`, `survive_eq_survivalFunction_ratio`↔`ccdfTx_ccdfX`.

## Main results

* `survivalFunction_zero` — `S_X(0) = 1` (`X > 0` a.e.).
* `survivalFunction_antitone`, `survivalFunction_le_one` — the survival function decreases in `[0, 1]`.
* `survive_zero` — `₀pₓ = 1` for a life alive at `x`.
* `survive_eq_survivalFunction_ratio` — `tpₓ = S_X(x+t) / S_X(x)` for `t ≥ 0`, the survival-ratio
  keystone: the conditional-probability definition of `survive` collapses to the ratio.
