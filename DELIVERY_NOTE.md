# Delivery Note

This repository is a reproducible Lean 4 / Isabelle verification artifact for stochastic-process benchmark statements drawn from Saporito-style course material.

The current honest status (refresh with `python3 -m python.coverage_report`):

- **45 entries** are delivery-claim ready (`full + library_wrapper`): 21 real derivations or structural definitions, 24 direct Mathlib / Degenne library invocations.
- **20 entries** are `reduced_core`: either algebraic/analytic core checks or Lean specifications where the textbook conclusion is encoded as a structure axiom rather than derived. Concentrated in `stochastic_calculus.json` (10/11; `sc-thm-6.2.5` Itô Isometry is now `full`), `girsanov_finance.json` (4/4), `poisson_processes.json` (3/5), `brownian_motion.json` (3/10) — these chapters depend on Itô calculus / Girsanov machinery that neither Mathlib nor Degenne has fully formalized yet.
- **0 entries** are `placeholder`.

A previous round of edits over-stated the audit by promoting 45 specification-based entries to `full`. Those promotions were rolled back: a structure with the textbook conclusion as a field, projected via `:= h.conclusion_field`, is not a derivation, and the audit should reflect that. After the rollback, real-proof work landed `mart-thm-2.2.9` (discrete martingale transform from `martingale_nat` + pull-out), `mart-thm-2.6.7` (FTAP ⇒ direction), `mart-thm-2.4.6` (Doob's `L^p` maximal inequality, end-to-end from Hölder + Fubini), `cond-prop-2.1.11.9` (conditional Jensen), 4 Brownian-motion martingale wraps (BM is a martingale, `B²−t` is a martingale, Wald exponential, Markov property), 4 continuous-martingale results (including stopped martingale, hitting time of an open set, and `cm-thm-4.3.10` real-time convergence in measure for `L^p`-bounded right-continuous martingales — full end-to-end derivation via shifted increment martingale, eLpNorm-triangle, Degenne `maximal_ineq_norm` + `rightCont_iSup_ofReal_ne_top`, and a `Nat.floor` set-inclusion argument), and `sc-thm-6.2.5` Itô isometry (full L²-extension via formal-combination step isometry + density of step indicators via orthogonal complement + π-system induction + `LinearMap.extendOfNorm`).

## What Is Ready To Say

Safe wording:

> We built a reproducible Lean 4 / Isabelle verification artifact covering 65 stochastic-process benchmark statements. All active prover obligations type-check. Under a strict faithfulness audit, 45 entries (69%) are full or direct library-backed theorem formalizations: 21 derive the textbook conclusion (or are structural definitions), 24 directly invoke a named Mathlib or Degenne (BrownianMotion) library theorem whose statement matches the benchmark. The remaining 20 entries are `reduced_core`: the active code is honest but is either a narrower algebraic/analytic check or a Lean specification structure that pins down the textbook STATEMENT (so any inhabitant satisfies it by construction) without DERIVING the conclusion. They concentrate in the chapters dependent on Itô calculus / Girsanov machinery (`stochastic_calculus.json`, `girsanov_finance.json`) that neither Mathlib nor Degenne has fully formalized yet. No entries are `placeholder`. The artifact identifies precisely where current Lean/Isabelle libraries support the course material and where new stochastic-process infrastructure is required.

Avoid:

> We formally proved all theorems in the course.

That claim is not supported. The honest version:

> We have faithful Lean STATEMENTS for all 65 textbook theorems, real derivations or library-backed proofs for 45 of them (21 full derivations + 24 library wrappers), and explicit specifications for the remaining 20 documenting what a real proof would need to construct.

## Why This Is Valuable Even At 45/65

- A runnable benchmark suite for stochastic-process formalization with reproducible Docker verification.
- Clear separation of formal prover checking from CAS-style symbolic checking.
- Precise Lean specifications for every textbook theorem — these document what a future Mathlib-grade construction must produce, and they are useful targets for collaboration.
- A three-tier roadmap (`FORMALIZATION_ROADMAP.md` + `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-06-real-proof-tiers.md`) showing which theorems support real Lean proofs today (Tier A: ~10 entries, including conditional Jensen and Doob L^p that Mathlib flags as TODOs), which require building Brownian motion (Tier B), and which require the stochastic-integral layer (Tier C, research-grade).

## Suggested Message To Saporito

Draft:

> Professor Saporito,
>
> I have been building a reproducible Lean 4 / Isabelle verification artifact around stochastic-process results from your course material. It now covers 65 benchmark statements with all active prover obligations type-checking. Under a strict audit:
>
> - 45 entries (69%) are real derivations or direct Mathlib / Degenne library-backed proofs.
> - 20 entries are Lean specifications: the structure encodes the textbook hypotheses and conclusion in Lean, so it precisely documents the theorem, but the conclusion is not yet derived from foundational primitives.
> - 0 entries are placeholders.
>
> The 21 reduced cores concentrate in chapters that depend on Itô calculus / Girsanov machinery (Chapter 5 stochastic calculus, Chapter 6 financial applications) — neither Mathlib nor Degenne's BrownianMotion repository has fully formalized that layer yet, so a real derivation there would require building substantial new mathematical infrastructure (research-grade Lean work, weeks to months per theorem).
>
> The remaining work on `LpContinuousMartingaleConvergence` — extending the natural-time `L^p` martingale-convergence theorem (already formalised) to continuous-time `t → ∞` under path right-continuity — uses Degenne's continuous-time Doob inequality and is a tractable next milestone.
>
> If useful as a collaboration seed, I would value your guidance on which of the 21 remaining reduced cores would be most valuable to attack first.
