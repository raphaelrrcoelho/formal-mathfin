# Quanto correction — re-export

The quanto-correction content (the quanto-adjusted forward and the correction
factor `exp(−ρ σ_S σ_FX T)`) has been folded into `BlackScholes/Dividends.lean`,
alongside Garman-Kohlhagen — both are foreign/dividend drift-adjustment
variants of the same BS pricing formula.

The namespace `HybridVerify` exposes `quantoForward` and
`quanto_correction_factor` through the transitive import.
