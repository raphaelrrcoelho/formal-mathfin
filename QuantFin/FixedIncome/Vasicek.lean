# Vasicek mean-reversion (deterministic part)

The Vasicek short-rate SDE is `dr_t = κ(θ − r_t) dt + σ dW_t`. With `σ = 0`
the deterministic ODE `dr/dt = κ(θ − r)` has explicit solution

  `r(t) = θ + (r₀ − θ) · e^{−κt}`,

exhibiting exponential mean reversion to `θ` at rate `κ`. We verify two
properties at the level of real-valued calculus:

* the closed form satisfies the ODE;
* limiting value `r(∞) = θ` (asymptotic, via positivity of `κ`).

The full Vasicek model including the stochastic part — the SDE closed-form
`r_t ~ N(r_0 e^{−κt} + θ(1−e^{−κt}), σ²(1−e^{−2κt})/(2κ))` — is formalized in
`QuantFin/FixedIncome/VasicekSDE.lean`, where the variance comes from the
simple-process Itô isometry on the deterministic integrand `e^{−κ(t−s)}`
(`Foundations/ItoIntegralSimple.lean`). This file covers only the
deterministic (mean-reversion ODE) part.

## The half-life

The Vasicek/OU mean-reversion has a characteristic *half-life*
`t_{1/2} = log 2 / κ`: the time at which the gap from the mean has closed
to half its initial value. Independent of `r₀` and `θ`; only the rate `κ`
matters. (Folded from the former `MeanReversionHalfLife.lean`.)

Results:

* `vasicekDeterministic`: definition `θ + (r₀ − θ) e^{−κt}`.
* `vasicekDeterministic_at_zero`: `r(0) = r₀`.
* `vasicekDeterministic_solves_ODE`: `dr/dt = κ(θ − r(t))`.
* `meanReversionHalfLife`: `log 2 / κ`.
* `vasicekDeterministic_at_halfLife`: at `t = log 2 / κ`, the gap is half
  the initial gap.
